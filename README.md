# Mass-spec-ion-statistics-calculator

Calculate the average number of m/z values found within a specified m/z range (and/or set of m/z bins) specified by the user from the command line and produce visual MS spectra PNG file;

The script was written in Python 3 and should work with Python 2;

The script accepts a file in fasta format as input to produce a PNG image file with MS spectra;

The script works by specifying the m/z range for the values to be displayed: default = [1000-1500];

The script allows to search for sequences with the residue sequence pattern of interest and displays the spectra;

The script allows to add accuracy option in Daltons or parts per a million (ppm);
